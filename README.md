## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- [React JS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as the build tool
- Mobile-first workflow
- Frontend Mentor starter template design

### What I learned

One of the main challenges was creating a responsive component while also ensuring that it was built efficiently and without unnecessary repetition. This helped me improve my ability to break down UI into reusable, maintainable components.

I also learned how to build responsive components using Tailwind CSS and practiced applying atomic design principles in React to structure components effectively.

### Continued development

In the future, I plan to rebuild this project using more modern React tools such as Context API, Redux, and Redux Toolkit. This will allow me to explore state management in larger applications and apply best practices for organizing scalable React projects.
